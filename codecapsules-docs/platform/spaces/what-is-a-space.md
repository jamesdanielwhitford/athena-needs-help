# What Is a Space?

![Teams contain Spaces and Spaces contain Capsules](../../docs/assets/faq/teamspacecapsule.png)

[Teams](../teams/what-is-a-team.md), Spaces, and [Capsules](../capsules/what-is-a-capsule.md) form the foundation of [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io).

A **Space** is an organizational tool for managing Capsules. Each Space can contain multiple Capsules, making it easier to structure and manage large or complex projects by grouping related Capsules together.
