# Installation and Usage

## Installation

The Code Capsules CLI is registered as an NPM package. To install the CLI globally, simply run:

```bash
npm i -g @codecapsules/cli
```

## Usage

Once installed, the Code Capsules CLI follows the same standard format as most CLI applications:

The CLI can be called by using `codecaps`. The first argument to the CLI should be the desired command you want to call (for example, `login`, `logout`, or `proxy`). Each command has a list of arguments and options that can be passed in, respective to the command. You can view the list of all commands and their requirements [here](../commands/).

### Command Layout

Here is a visualized layout for using the Code Capsules CLI

```bash
codecaps <command> <arguments> [options]
```
