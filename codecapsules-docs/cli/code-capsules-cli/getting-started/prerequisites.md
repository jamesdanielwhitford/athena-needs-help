# Prerequisites

To access services provided via the Code Capsules CLI, you are required to have a registered account on [Code Capsules](https://app.codecapsules.io/).

If you have not used Code Capsules before, we recommend reading our documentation [introducing the platform](https://app.gitbook.com/s/gIlxo9gU7Lotj1cdGRh6/what-is-code-capsules), and setting up your first [Team](https://app.gitbook.com/s/gIlxo9gU7Lotj1cdGRh6/teams/what-is-a-team), [Space](https://app.gitbook.com/s/gIlxo9gU7Lotj1cdGRh6/spaces/what-is-a-space) and [Capsule](https://app.gitbook.com/s/gIlxo9gU7Lotj1cdGRh6/capsules/what-is-a-capsule) before using the CLI.



## Next Steps

Once you are set up and comfortable with the Code Capsules platform, you are ready to [install the CLI](installation-and-usage.md).
